      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-4">Safety Tips</h3>
      <p className="mb-2">While Madrid is generally safe, bag-snatching and wallet-lifting are unfortunately all too common. But with a little planning ahead and a lot of paying attention, you can travel around more securely.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-2 font-medium">Before you go out:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-2">
        <li>Do not carry everything with you. Only take one or two credit/bank cards, a little cash and, most importantly, a copy of your passport with you.</li>
        <li>Write down the numbers of the credit/bank cards that you are taking with you and the phone numbers listed on the back.</li>
        <li>Carry your valuables in a secure place. Use a bag that rests snugly under your arm in the armpit region or directly in front of you.</li>
        <li>Beware the backpack. Use a suitcase or combination lock.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p className="mb-2 font-medium">While you're out and about:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-2">
        <li>Beware, most pocket-pickers work in teams and observe potential targets ahead of time. Their chief tool is distraction.</li>
        <li>Beware of people asking you for directions, shoving maps in your face, asking if you've noticed a stain on your shirt, etc.</li>
        <li>In crowded places, you're already expecting to be bumped into, making you an easier target.</li>
        <li>When sitting, keep your bag physically touching you, preferably in your lap or linked onto your body.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p className="mb-2 font-medium">If you've been mugged:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Establish what you have lost and take appropriate action.</li>
        <li>For lost credit/bank cards, make the necessary phone calls.</li>
        <li>For lost passports, go to the nearest police station to file a report, then take it to your embassy.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p className="mb-2">Emergency phone service: 112. Available toll-free from any phone for any emergency.</p>
